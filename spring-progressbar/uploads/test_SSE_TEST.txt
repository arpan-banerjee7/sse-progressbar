SSE is a lightweight protocol on top of HHTP Streaming that allows super light-weight subscribe-only capabilities to clients. Unlike WebSockets, SSE does not provide the capability of two-way communication but can be used by the server to push data to the clients in real-time. SSE enables a client to receive automatic updates from a server via an HTTP connection. It is designed to use the JavaScript EventSource API to subscribe to a stream of data in any popular browser. Through this interface, a client requests a particular URL to receive an event stream.
You might consider using Server-Sent Events when you have some rapidly updating data to display, but you do not want to poll the server. Examples might include displaying the status of a long-running business process, tracking stock price updates, or showing the current number of likes on a post on a social media network.
